# Arduino-C-Supersonic-controlled-servo-motor
Single code to control a servo motor with  supersonic sensor. 
This project contains a single code for Arduino (C++) which gives you the ability to control a servo motor with a simple supersonic sensor.
By directing the supersonic sensor to different objects around you, the servo motor will rotate according to the objects distance from the supersonic sensor.
The more distant the object is, the servo will rotate to set a greater angle.
